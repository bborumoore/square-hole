### Description
This is my first attempt at making a video game.  Inspired by Temple Run, Brackeys on YouTube, and the "That's right! It goes in the square hole!" video, this game is fairly simple in design, but has plenty of room to grow.

---
### How to Use
This repo holds my source code and a full WebGL compatible build of the game. You can fork the repo if you'd like to tweak the code to your liking, or you can simply download and run the build folder to try the game out in it's current state.

### Future Development
There are several improvements to this game prototype that I may come back to later to make.  Here are some planned improvements (suggestions welcome!):
- Implement a lose condition (ie running into obstacles)
- Allow players to destroy/pass through blocks of the same color
- Allow players to change shapes
- Create obstacles to allow specific shapes through
- Have player pick up color/shape-change charges, use them as consumables
- Add audio track
- Add procedural generation of levels
- Add a dynamic background

If you or someone you know is interested in helping to flesh out this project, or if you have any suggestions that you feel could make the game more interesting, please feel free to reach out!

As stated above, I'm fairly new to coding and development, but I love it here.  My projects in the Automotive industry pushed me to learn about Database structures and analysis, and it was a small step from there to web development and video game design.  Please feel free to peruse my repos!
